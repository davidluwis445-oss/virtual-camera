# 🎥 Virtual Camera Replacement - FIXED! 

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

The main issue was that the **"REPLACE" button** in the HomeScreen was calling `performComprehensiveRestore()` instead of actually setting up the virtual camera replacement. This meant it was only restoring disabled camera apps instead of installing the virtual camera system.

### **Root Cause:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE (WRONG):
onReplaceCamera = {
    performComprehensiveRestore(context, systemVirtualCamera) { enabled, disabled ->
        enabledCameraApps = enabled
        disabledCameraApps = disabled
    }
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
onReplaceCamera = {
    setupVirtualCameraReplacement(context, systemVirtualCamera) { success, message ->
        if (success) {
            Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        } else {
            Toast.makeText(context, "❌ $message", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        }
    }
}
```

## ✅ **What's Now Working**
